## Theory Climbing

This website was built to sell climbing clothing and merchandise. 

As an avid rock climber with over 7 years of experience, some friends and I wanted to start creating climbing merchandise, including clothes and posters. To bring that idea to life, I built this website. Theory Climbing combines my passion for climbing with my skills in web development. The site was built using a modern tech stack, featuring Supabase for secure authentication and the Stripe API for a seamless, stateless checkout experience.  

This is version 2.0 of the website. Originally built with Next.js, I wanted to challenge myself by rebuilding it with a more refined tech stack and a fresh approach.
